Final Exam Example: Object-Oriented Programming in Java
Question 3 (25 points)
You are tasked with designing a cybersecurity system to monitor various types of network traffic and detect potential threats. Create a complete Java program that models this system using object-oriented principles.
Your program must include:

An interface called SecurityMonitor that declares methods for:

Calculating threat levels based on network traffic volume
Logging security activities


An abstract class called NetworkDevice that:

Implements the SecurityMonitor interface
Contains fields for device name, IP address, and baseline threat level
Includes a constructor that initializes these fields
Provides a method to display device information
Contains both a basic and an overloaded version of the threat calculation method
Declares an abstract method for responding to threats


Three concrete subclasses that extend NetworkDevice:

Router - with specialized threat calculation based on connected devices
Server - with different threat responses for various service types
Firewall - with threat detection capabilities based on ruleset versions


A driver class that demonstrates:

Creating instances of each device type
Storing them in an array of the parent type
Processing different types of network traffic through each device
Displaying appropriate threat levels and responses



Your solution will be graded on:

Correct implementation of inheritance
Proper use of interfaces
Implementation of method overriding and overloading
Effective use of polymorphism
Appropriate constructor design with super() calls
Code organization and documentation
